Exploring html free JS in the web browser.

Interesting relationship between React.js ( https://blog.risingstack.com/the-history-of-react-js-on-a-timeline, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)) and Flutter(https://flutter.dev/), Stateful or Stateless components aka widgets. React.js version of virtual Dom (See React.js https://youtu.be/XxVg_s8xAms, about patterns) feels like a variant of the Presentation Model pattern - see a good discussion on the that here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2009/february/patterns-wpf-apps-with-the-model-view-viewmodel-design-pattern.   See here about Flutter Widgets Stateless and Stateful (https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro), see here about some State in React.js, https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html. 

The question gets broader. Can we express features of a range of webby techs, using vanilla or perhaps the curernt JavaScript - ES6? Ok now we move onto thinking about application patterns. Can MVC or MVMM (PM) design patterns be expressed in ES6( or waht comes next)? So myJSApp.js is a quick DOM explore - yup can create DOM nodes and add them to the DOM and associate event handlers with them. What is next? Can I work an MVC in ES6? That is next.
